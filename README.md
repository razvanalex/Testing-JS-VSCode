# Testing ES6 in VSCode using Mocha sidebar extension

This skeleton contains all necessary configurations for vscode to run Mocha sidebar for ES6.
Just clone this repo, add your source files in `./lib`, edit `./package.json` to fit your needs
and write the tests in `./test`.

To just test the results, run:
```
# npm test
```

To check the coverage, run:
```
# npm run coverage
```

To generate the coverage html (generated by istanbul [1]), run:
```
# npm run report
```
And then open in your browser `./coverage/index.html`

Make sure you have installed all the dependencies required for your project.

*Note*: Remove `node_modules` and `coverage` folders after cloning to avoid any problems.
